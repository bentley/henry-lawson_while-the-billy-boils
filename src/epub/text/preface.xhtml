			<p>In the absence of the author, who is now resident in <span epub:type="z3998:place">Western Australia</span>, it devolves upon us to make the customary acknowledgments to the various journals from which these stories are reprinted. Most of them first appeared in the <span epub:type="z3998:place">Sydney</span> <i epub:type="se:name.publication.newspaper">Bulletin</i>, a number of them in the <span epub:type="z3998:place">Sydney</span> <i epub:type="se:name.publication.newspaper">Worker</i>, and others in the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.newspaper">New Zealand Mail</i>, the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.newspaper">New Zealand Times</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:place">Sydney</span> <i epub:type="se:name.publication.newspaper">Truth</i>, the <span epub:type="z3998:place">Brisbane</span> <i epub:type="se:name.publication.newspaper">Boomerang</i>, the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.newspaper">Maryborough Patriot</i>, and <i epub:type="se:name.publication.newspaper">The Antipodean</i>, while two are now published for the first time.</p>
			<p>We might rightly be deemed ungrateful did we not take this opportunity of thanking the Press of <span epub:type="z3998:place">Australia</span> and <span epub:type="z3998:place">New Zealand</span> for the aid they have given us in our effort to publish here, and in a presentable form, the work of some of our living writers. Especially are our thanks due to the proprietors of the <span epub:type="z3998:place">Sydney</span> <i epub:type="se:name.publication.newspaper">Bulletin</i> who have in many ways assisted us.</p>
